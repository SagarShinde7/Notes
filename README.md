Notes
I have done a Note-taking application project this is my recent project. Notes app is used for making short text notes, updating when you need them, and trashing when you are done. Allow storing all notes and essential information digitally.
This project was built using React.
Adding notes, delete note, search note and change the UI to dark mode and light mode.
